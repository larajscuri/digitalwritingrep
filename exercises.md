1. What elements of the works ("Taroko Gorge", "The Gathering Cloud", "First Draft of the Revolution", and "Shade") do you read?
   * *Taroko Gorge*: randomly generated, making patterned generated sentences that appear differently each time you interact however, they all describe this specific place.
   * *The Gathering Cloud*: a mixture of pictures, motion, words and poetry. You click through the pages, get drop down boxes that explains things further. 
   * *First Draft of the Revolution*:
   * *Shade*: it is IF (interactive fiction) so you are moving through the game as the main character and type responses to figure out and unfold the story in front of you.
2. How are those elements meaningful?
   * *Taroko Gorge*'s randomly generative feature could reflect how everyone has individual perception of everything. The same place/event may vary for every person even though they have had the same experience.
   * *The gathering cloud*: 
   * *First draft of the revolution*:
   * *Shade*: In the game, you essentially experience a weird in-between death and afterlife place. You, the character, have died, but you are experiencing life as though you are alive waiting to leave for a trip, even though you died on the trip. But you have to figure this out through typing responses, finding things, inspecting things ect. But failing is essentially part of the metaphor of being in this purgatory-like space. The physical constraints placed on you are to simulate the character's psychological and personality characteristics. 
3. How are the works read differently from print literature?
   * *Taroko Gorge* reads differently because of its face past, a line appears at the bottom and the top one disappears as a new one does. The poem can go on forever. This cannot happen in print literature. The computerised convention adds a layer of meaning that would be lost without the technology.
   * *The gathering cloud*:
   * *First draft of the revolution*:
   * *Shade*: the interactive feature makes this different from print literature. You live as the character navigates the world as the character. whilst there is a bigger narrative you have to figure out that could translate into a novel/short story. The interactive feature makes it feel more lived. As well, the interactive feature allows you to feel like the character, unsure, restricted ect. 
4. How is electronic literature different from print literature?
   * Electronic literature pushes the conventions of the print forcing the audience to re-think the preconceived notions of literature. It often has interactive features, auditory or visual elements that rely on computers and technology to materialise it. These elements are often not additional but crucial to the piece's themes and conventions.
5. What are the qualities of the works we might consider as qualities of electronic literature?
   * *Taroko Gorge*: moving, appearing/disappearing, generative
   * *The gathering cloud*:
   * *First draft of the revolution*:
   * *Shade*: interactive fiction, second person
