# Artists Bio #
Lara Scuri is a fiction writer and poet based in Melbourne, Victoria. She is currently in her third year of a Bachelor of Arts (Creative Writing) at RMIT University. Raised in a small city in New South Wales, her poetry reflects on this through the exploration of familial dynamics, mental health, and queer experiences, often adopting a nostalgic and coming-of-age tone. Her prose delves into similar themes while also exploring a diverse array of topics, including religion and politics. Lara's work has been published in RMIT Catalyst magazine (volumes 78.5, 80.1, and 80.2), and she is a Creative Writing Officer for the magazine as of 2024.
