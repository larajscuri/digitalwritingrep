# Annotations
# Reflection on Hypertext
## How is it different from fiction?
- Giving the reader choice through the web.
- Playing with the order of things.
- Linearity is murkier.
## How is it different from games?
- Relying on writing more than visuals.
- Set of rules, having the ability to explain these rules.
- Hypertext fiction is sometimes subjective
- Gameplay is a form of making meaning
- Digital media: if gameplay is not producing meaning, is it useful?
# Engagement with Works of Electronic Literature

- This game was quite frustrating to play—I did have to play it a couple of times before I understood the mechanics and got the full story. It is interesting to read a story in this way where you feel so involved with it. The second person perspective really places you in the position of the character and you begin to really feel as if you are this character, trying to discover what happened to you.

- Much like Shade, the closeness created through this IF game was interesting and something I would like to emulate through my piece. I think I’ve always viewed books/literature as an embodied experience where you can see the world through different eyes, but there is a powerfulness in the way IF and digital literature achieve this. 
- I think it is more than the second person pronoun, although it contributes to it. The interactions and choices you are given give the user a sense of autonomy over the character, providing this immersion that we don’t really gain when reading print literature. 
- I really felt like the protagonist and began to understand their struggles as I continued to play as them. It was a great navigation of mental health, what it really is like to live with depression, and how it affects everything.

- I thoroughly enjoyed playing this interactive fiction game. I thought all the elements, visual, audible and interactive, all came together and cultivated this intense feeling of loss for the user.
- This is the type of digital literature I gravitate to; I feel as though it is a nice mix of interactive gameplay and narrative as well as having the audio and visual components that tie the story in together.

## What elements of the works ("<a href="https://nickm.com/taroko_gorge/">Taroko Gorge</a>", "<a href="https://luckysoap.com/thegatheringcloud/">The Gathering Cloud</a>", "<a href="https://lizadaly.com/first-draft/content/index.html">First Draft of the Revolution</a>", and "Shade") do you read?  
- Taroko Gorge: randomly generated, making patterned generated sentences that appear differently. All describing a specific place.
- The Gathering Cloud: a mixture of pictures, motion, words and poetry. You click through the pages and get drop-down boxes that explain things further.
-	First Draft of the Revolution: Hypertext fiction, uses hyperlinks to expand and follow the story
- Shade: it is IF (interactive fiction) so you are moving through the game as the main character and typing responses to figure out and unfold the story in front of you.
## How are those elements meaningful?
- Taroko Gorge's randomly generative feature could reflect how everyone has their own perception of a place. The same place/event may vary for every person even though they have had the same experience.
- The gathering cloud: It evokes a sense of environmental consciousness that is often neglected. Through its poetry + images, it emphasises the environmental burden modern society poses on the earth.
- First draft of the revolution: you read letters written to Henri, and you are able to choose them to be rewritten to review more or conceal.
- Shade: In the game, you essentially experience a weird in-between death and afterlife place. You, the character, have died, but you are experiencing life as though you are alive waiting to leave for a trip, even though you died on the trip. But you have to figure this out through typing responses, finding things, inspecting things ect. But failing is essentially part of the metaphor of being in this purgatory-like space. The physical constraints placed on you are simulating the character's psychological state.
## How are the works read differently from print literature?
- Taroko Gorge reads differently because of its fast pace, a line appears at the bottom and the top one disappears as a new one does. The poem can go on forever. This cannot happen in print literature. The computerised convention adds a layer of meaning that would be lost without the technology.
- The gathering cloud: the images of cute animals place them in the forefront of the author's mind, showing the real-life impact our modern society has on the environment.
- First draft of the revolution: the ability to choose, and rewrite letters emphasises the process of writing to another person and the choices that go into it.
- Shade: the interactive feature makes this different from print literature. You live as the character navigating the world. whilst there is a bigger narrative you have to figure out that could translate into a novel/short story. The interactive feature makes it feel more lived. As well, the interactive feature allows you to feel like the character, unsure, restricted ect.
## How is electronic literature different from print literature?
- Electronic literature pushes the conventions of print, forcing the audience to re-think the preconceived notions of literature. It often has interactive features, auditory or visual elements that rely on computers and technology to materialise it. These elements are often not additional but crucial to the piece's themes and conventions.
- What are the qualities of the works we might consider as qualities of electronic literature?
- Taroko Gorge: moving, appearing/disappearing, generative
- The gathering cloud: pictures, motion, hyperlink.
- First draft of the revolution: hyperlink, choices, interactive
- Shade: interactive fiction, second person
# Engagement with the Readings
## <a href="https://electronicbookreview.com/essay/enlightening-interactive-fiction-andrew-plotkins-shade/">Enlightening Interactive Fiction: Andrew Plotkin’s Shade – Jeremy Douglass</a>
- This enlightened me on the way in which you can use interaction as a vessel for storytelling. Having the error messages communicate and allude to the user being dead and this being a sort of purgatory revealed this to me, it was a clever way to use the forms conventions in the narrative.
- It makes it uniquely digital, as you could not do this if it was print. 
## <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/books/edited-volume/2676/New-Media-PoeticsContexts-Technotexts-and-Theories">Beyond Taxonomy: Digital Poetics and the Problem of Reading – Talan Memmott</a>
- This reading succinctly describes the different elements involved with digital writing that work to elevate the piece.
- The idea that they are all purposeful decisions, made to curate and add to the narrative.
