# Objectives
## Initial Objective 
-	To create a thriller/mystery game that explores a mythologised, abandoned home in a small town. The users will explore the six main rooms of this house, slowly uncovering its secrets and why the house was abandoned all that time ago. Through interactions with sprites (characters) and items, the user will gain the big picture, discovering the true horrors within the house and how their character, Kate, is the daughter, reliving her childhood after a PTSD episode. 
-	I want to play around with the conventions and limitations of interactivity as seen in the IF game Shade. This will not only subtly nod at the user’s connection with the house but allow me to implement interaction as a vessel of storytelling. 
-	I want to ultimately explore how domestic violence cases are often overshadowed, not only in media and with police/judicial systems but in social circles. There is still a level of normalising violent behaviours against women particularly seen in the genre of horror as there is often a disproportional depiction of violence against women. Furthermore, when cases of domestic violence are brought up in media, there is still a level of downplaying or rationalising the “why” when often it is due to patriarchal systems in society that have ultimately normalised violent attitudes against women. 
-	I utilised the idea of curses and demons causing someone to go mad as one of these apparatuses the town uses to rationalise and hide the true horrors that occurred in the house as an almost manifestation of guilt because no one in the town stepped in even though it was to extend, widely known. 
## Changes in Objective
-	Due to the inability to show certain things such as a lapse in memory and distortion in the visuals to my liking, I tweaked the ending. Its decision was not only made due to the limitations of bitsy, but as I was writing the narrative, I found it increasingly difficult to create an ending that was satisfactory with this plan. 
-	I still wanted the user’s character to have a connection to the house but having that connection being Kate as the daughter caused a couple of plot holes and roadblocks. In the end, I found it easier to have the user be the granddaughter who was unaware of her mother’s connection to the house but had heard the stories within the town. When she finally stumbles across this information, she sets out to explore the house to discover what truly happened. 
-	In this change, I’ve had to further lean into the paranormal elements as I still wanted to have these conversations with the father and mother. Whilst I was hesitant as I thought it may contradict what I was trying to convey regarding the rationalisation of domestic violence, I was able to work around this. The characters ‘haunting the house’ became a way to convey the mother’s feelings towards her fate. She cannot move on to the afterlife due to her desire to not become forgotten or reduced to a victim of domestic violence. The father becomes trapped too due to his crimes against his wife. I drew on ideas of punishment found within Dante’s inferno and the ninth circle of hell, treachery. The coldness of the room alludes to how all the souls in this circle are submerged in ice, as well as the actual scene where someone asks Dante to wipe their tears, but he refuses based on their sins. Kate cannot forgive him. 
## Successes in Objective 
-	The overall objective, I believe, was achieved through my piece. Not only did I compose 6-8 rooms, but I was able to establish key items and sprites that all provide critical information to the user, painting the larger story at hand.
-	I think I was able to build a sense of tension through the slow revealing story.
-	Through the uses of exits and endings I was able to change the rooms slightly, creating this paranormal feeling to the piece. 
-	I believe the moral and theme, whilst tweaked, was still communicated. The mythologisation of these people’s lives added a level of mysticism to a real-life story, almost removing the human aspect. This made the people in the town feel comfortable with theorising and creating stories about what happened. But this does nothing in bringing justice to the victims of femicide, it only diminishes the real horrors of the crime. 
# Inspirations for my piece
## <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1pVLJl_snc">Opal: Short Film</a> 
- The structure of exploring each room of an “abandoned” or scary house.
- How each family member reveals more about how dysfunctional the house is. 
## <a href="https://rascalin.itch.io/hotel-infinity">Hotel Infinity: Bitsy Story</a>
- Some technical aspects of this story I would like to emulate.
- Dialogue choices in Bitsy game.
- Having the character disappear or fade away.
## <a href="https://hideous-cave-goblin.itch.io/chronotopophobia">Chrontopophobia: Bitsy Story</a>
- The creepy vibe was so unsettling, perhaps I won’t emulate this to a great  extent but it was good to see how this atmosphere can be curated in bitsy
- The glitchy graphics for the computer I will attempt to emulate with the TV
## <a href="https://ruin.itch.io/minimalist">Minimalist: Bitsy Story</a> 
- How items can hold stories and information about a person.

- Dante believed there were nine circles of hell, representing a gradual descent into increasing levels of sin and punishment with the ninth one being the worst perceived sin, treachery. It is described as the “lowest, blackest, and farthest from Heaven” and is described as a frozen landscape. There are rings within the circle describing different forms of treachery with Canial being a betrayal of blood, Antenora being a betrayal of God and Ptolemy being a betrayal of guests.
- I plan to have allusions to Ptolemy, the betrayal of the guest. Whilst the father did betray his blood, he mainly betrayed his wife, a woman he invited into his life, and built a home and a family with by choice. I chose this one as opposed to Canial as Ptolemy is perceived, by Dante as worse than a betrayal of a blood relationship as you have no control over your blood.
