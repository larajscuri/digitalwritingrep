# Reflections on Class Experiments 
## Remix "We Walk to You
-	This experiment allowed me to understand the HTML coding language to a greater extent. As I am very inexperienced with any sort of code language, the idea of learning it was daunting as I thought it might go over my head. 
-	Having the code already written out was helpful as I was able to see the full picture of what is needed/how certain things like font and colour function. Tweaking little things allowed me to understand the small details as well as see how things can break if certain characters like brackets aren’t included. 
## Twine experiment
-	Having done the remix of “We Walk to You”, twine became a little less intimidating as I understood a little bit on how to change font, colour ect. 
-	While I only did a small experiment with minimal coding required, it was interesting to see the mechanics of interactive fiction and how much thought is put behind everything. 
-	Critically thinking about the reasoning behind details from the font to the colour, as well as the links between passages and what you want this to convey to your audience forces you to reevaluate your writing. It becomes something much more than words, something multi-dimensional.
# Reflection on Experiments for Assignment. 
## Original play around with Bitsy
-	I wanted to get the hang of the mechanics of bitsy. I implemented a little bit of animation, items and dialogue. I was unsure how to make it so the avatar could not move up walls. I was also unsure how to make it, so the sprite does not block out the square that it is on. 
-	My first time experimenting with <a href="https://ruin.itch.io/pixsy">Pixsy</a> did not turn out how I would like it. It feels very messy and editing it tile by tile feels tedious. As I only have a couple of weeks to complete this work, I am looking for alternative methods to create these more efficient rooms.

## Second play around with Bitsy
-	I was able to find out through YouTube and Bitsy forums that Photoshop is an effective and efficient way to make rooms. 
-	Bitsy only allows you to edit square by square, making it difficult and tedious to draw rooms as many objects such as beds, or doors, require multiple squares. I was able to create the same grids in Photoshop and the application allowed me to draw without the limitation of editing square by square. 
-	I used this template on the right that reflects the pixels and layout on the bitsy game maker. 
-	This prologue was cut out in the final piece as I felt it was too descriptive and overtook the interactive element. It felt as though if it was written out in a print book, it would have the same effect. 
## Choice dialogue experiment (failed)
-	In my desire to make this interactive fiction as immersive as possible, I was hoping I could reflect a twine-like choice option within the dialogue. I tried to achieve this by giving the user a choice between answering a phone call. If they declined it would go to voicemail but if they chose to accept it would reveal more about the character. 
-	I found out I would have to hack the game through Borksy, however, there was minimal information online that was comprehensible to me. 
-	After asking my tutor, I was able to get somewhere (as seen in the link), but something still wasn’t clicking, and it wasn’t showing up right. Trialling this hack was beginning to take up a lot of my time, and with the ending still not thought out, I opted to go without this piece of interactivity to conserve my energy and time. 
## Second prototype without ending
-	This is my second prototype. 
-	It still has a lingering hack in the code from my attempt to make dialogue choices which makes the readability difficult.
-	I still believe sometimes it is overly descriptive, taking away from the interactivity thus I will workshop the dialogue further this week. 
## Play around with manipulating reality pt. 1
-	After workshopping my ending, I needed to lean more into the paranormal element, so I wanted to make the room go static like the TV to reflect the spirit warping the user’s reality. I will be using exits and endings to create this.
-	This was successful though I do have worries about the player stepping into it earlier or not realising they have to do this step to progress. 
## Play around with manipulating reality pt 2
-	I wanted to have the mother disappear after their conversation to reflect her moving on after gaining closure from Kate. 
-	I tried to implement another hack of hiding her in another room but unfortunately, I could not get this hack to work.
-	I decided to do something similar to what I did for the father. Again this was a success.  
## Music
-	I realised halfway through creating my piece that the music in many of the bitsy games I was playing and interacting with was not the music implemented in the game. 
-	As a result, I almost left music out of my piece entirely as I felt it did not add anything to the story or narrative. 
-	After discovering <a href="https://kool.tools/bitsy/tools/bitsymuse-ui/">Bitsy Muse UI</a> Bitsy Muse ui, I created some small, looping tracks to go into each room with an engine called <a href="https://zenzoa.itch.io/mosi">Mosi</a> and will try to add them to the game.
-	I could not get it to work with multiple mp3 files as well it seems like Bitsy Muse does not work with some versions of Bitsy. So, I used another <a href="https://kool.tools/bitsy/tools/add-bitsy-audio/">website</a> and <a href="https://www.beepbox.co/#9n31s0k0l00e03t2ma7g0fj07r1i0o432T1v1u93f10l7q8121d35A8F4B0Qd007P5aa3E1639T1v1u64f0qwx10u211d08A1F2B5Q20a0Pe64bE3b662776T1v1u95f0q0z10u231d19AcFhBcQ0358P8888E1bfT2v1u15f10w4qw02d03w0E0b4h400000000h4g000000014h000000004h400000000p1bFE-NVS00000">Beepbox</a> to create a longer track.
-	I am a little disappointed as I wanted to music to change in the TV room and the ending but I am still satisfied with what I have.
